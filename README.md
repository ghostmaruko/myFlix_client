## Reflections

Role & Tasks: Developed the full frontend in React, integrated authentication with JWT, implemented movie search/filter, and styled the app with Bootstrap.

Decisions & Consequences: Chose React Router for SPA navigation and React Bootstrap for consistent styling, which improved maintainability and responsiveness.

Lessons Learned: Learned to handle client-side routing, search/filter logic, error handling, and safe state updates with React hooks.

Future Improvements: Could add pagination, more advanced search (genre, year), and unit testing for components.
